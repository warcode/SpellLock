SpellLock
========================
AddOn for World of Warcraft (not updated to latest versions)

SpellLock tracks spell school lockouts on enemy player targets by you or members of your party. It also tracks cooldowns for spells that cause lockouts cast by enemy players in the arena.

It has the option of using DBM for warnings and bars in addition to (or instead of) the built-in bars. SpellLock can write to party chat when a lock occurs.

You can access the options through the blizzard UI or by using "/slock"
